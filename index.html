            <h2>Section 1: A basic chart</h2>
            <p> 
                We've organised the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description. Here, we can describe the chart and give some context.
                As a first example, we're using the basic chart from the previous session.
            </p>

        <figure id="Location3"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->

            <h2>Section 2: Another Chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is a more advanced chart. We'll cover charts like this in more detail later today. Don't worry if you don't understand it yet.
                Feel free to replace both charts with your own examples.

    <!-- Do you want to add more sections? -->
        <!-- Try copying pasting the section above -->
        <!-- You'll need to change the id of the figure "<figure id="Location3"... -->
        <!-- ... and add a new variable for the graph spec in the script at the bottom of the page -->

        // Do you want to add more graphs?

        // e.g. 
        // var figure_3_spec = ...
        // vegaEmbed('#Location3', figure_3_spec)
